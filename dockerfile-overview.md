# Dockerfile Overview

This repository contains a **Dockerfile** that automates the creation of a Docker image for running an application inside a container.

## **Dockerfile Structure**

A Dockerfile consists of various instructions that define how an image is built. Below is an overview of the key components:

### **1. Base Image (`FROM`)**

Specifies the base operating system or software environment.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

### **2. Maintainer (`LABEL`)**

Defines metadata such as the maintainer's information.

```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"
```

### **3. Working Directory (`WORKDIR`)**

Sets the default working directory inside the container.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

### **4. Copying Files (`COPY` / `ADD`)**

Transfers files from the host system into the container.

```dockerfile
COPY . /app
ADD myfile.tar.gz /app/
```

### **5. Installing Dependencies (`RUN`)**

Executes commands to install necessary packages.

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
```

### **6. Environment Variables (`ENV`)**

Defines runtime environment variables.

```dockerfile
ENV APP_ENV=production
```

### **7. Exposing Ports (`EXPOSE`)**

Indicates which ports the container will listen on.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
```

### **8. Defining a Command (`CMD` / `ENTRYPOINT`)**

Specifies the default command to run the application.

```dockerfile
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
```

### **9. Passing Build-Time Arguments (`ARG`)**

Defines variables that can be set during the build process.

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=1.0
```

### **10. Optimizing Layers (`RUN` Cleanup)**

Reduces image size by combining commands into a single layer.

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    curl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## **Example Dockerfile**

A sample Dockerfile for a Python application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the local files into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

---

## **Building and Running the Docker Image**

Follow these steps to build and run the Docker container:

### **1. Build the Docker Image**

```sh
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

### **2. Run the Docker Container**

```sh
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
```

This will start the application and make it accessible on **port 5000**.
